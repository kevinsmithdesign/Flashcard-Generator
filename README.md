# Flashcard-Generator

In this assignment, I created the backend for a basic flashcard application. The backend constitutes an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards. Basic flashcard, which have a front ("What is the capital of Texas"), and a back ("Austin"). The Cloze flashcard presents partial text ("_____ is the capital of Brazil."), and the full text when the user request it ("Brasilia is the capital of Brazil").
